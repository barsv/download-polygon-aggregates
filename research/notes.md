question: maybe it's better to filter prices by a given exchange instead of the use of trades aggegated across all
exchanges. especially if the all trades flat files contain something that was traded OTC. because OTC trades might be
far from best bid/ask on a given exchange at the moment. such OTC deals will be creating spikes in volume and jumps in price.
